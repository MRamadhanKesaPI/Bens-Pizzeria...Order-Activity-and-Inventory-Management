## Project Background
Ben's Pizzeria, a new and small pizzeria, focuses only on delivery or pickup. Based in Houston, it has already delivered to customers in cities like Austin, Dallas, and El Paso. As the owner, Ben is looking for opportunities to help the pizzeria grow in the long term by focusing solely on delivery. With hopes for future growth, Ben wants to analyze the sales patterns of the pizzeria. 

He also wants to manage the inventory better by tracking underperforming products and adding more ingredients for popular items. To address these challenges, Ben's Pizzeria has provided two months of orders and inventory data to uncover insights into recent trends for optimizing sales and inventory management.

These final datasets were created through the process of creating view ini PostgreSQL, which can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/Data-Preparation-Process_for_PhoneNow...Customer-Churn/).

#### *Insights*
#### 1. Top-Selling Items & Categories:  
   - Pizza is the highest-grossing category, dominating sales compared to sides, beverages, and desserts.  
   - Chicken wings and Dr. Pepper have strong sales, which might be surprising beside the pizza items. 

#### 2. Revenue & Order Trends:  
   - Peak sales occur during lunch and evening hours.  
   - There is a fluctuation in order volume throughout the day, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.  

#### 3. Delivery vs. Pickup Distribution: 
   - Delivery accounts for *73.07%* of total orders, while pickup represents *26.93%*, reinforcing the need to optimize delivery logistics.  

#### 4. Inventory Stock & Management:  
   - Some ingredients, such as Dr. Pepper and Pepsi, have critically low stock levels (<25%).  
   - Pizza dough, Mozarella, and key pizza toppings have moderate stock depletion, requiring restocking strategies.

#### 2. Optimize Sales Strategies:  
   - Focus on marketing top-selling items to maximize revenue.  
   - Offer promotions during low-order periods to balance sales.  

#### 3. Improve Delivery Operations:
