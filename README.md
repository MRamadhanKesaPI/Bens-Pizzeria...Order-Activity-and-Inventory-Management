## Project Background
Ben’s Pizzeria is a small, newly established pizzeria specializing in delivery and pickup. Based in Houston, it has already served customers in Austin, Dallas, and El Paso. With a focus on long-term growth, the business aims to optimize sales and improve inventory management. 

Key objectives include identifying outperforming products, ensuring sufficient stock for popular items, and refining overall sales strategies. To support these efforts, Ben’s Pizzeria has provided two months of orders and inventory data to uncover insights into recent trends and inform data-driven decisions.

### Purpose of the Analysis:
The goal of this analysis is to help Ben’s Pizzeria make data-driven decisions to improve sales and inventory management. The goals are to:

- Analyze sales trends and customer ordering patterns to maximize revenue opportunities.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve delivery efficiency and enhance customer experience.
- Identify best-selling and underperforming items to optimize inventory and reduce waste.

These final datasets were created through the process of creating view ini PostgreSQL, which can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/Data-Preparation-Process_for_PhoneNow...Customer-Churn/).

## Insights
#### 1. Top-Selling Items & Categories:  
   - Pizza is the highest-grossing category, dominating sales compared to sides, beverages, and desserts.  
   - Chicken wings and Dr. Pepper have strong sales, which might be surprising beside the pizza items. 

#### 2. Revenue & Order Trends:  
   - Peak sales occur during lunch and evening hours.  
   - There is a fluctuation in order volume throughout the day, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.  

#### 3. Delivery vs. Pickup Distribution: 
   - Delivery accounts for *73.07%* of total orders, while pickup represents *26.93%*, reinforcing the need to optimize delivery logistics.  

#### 4. Inventory Stock & Management:  
   - Some ingredients, such as Dr. Pepper and Pepsi, have critically low stock levels (<25%).  
   - Pizza dough, Mozarella, and key pizza toppings have moderate stock depletion, requiring restocking strategies.

## Recommendations
#### 1. Enhance Inventory Management:  
   - Increase stock for high-demand items (e.g., cheese, pizza dough) to prevent shortages.  
   - Reduce procurement for underperforming beverages and sides.  

#### 2. Optimize Sales Strategies:  
   - Focus on marketing top-selling items to maximize revenue.  
   - Offer promotions during low-order periods to balance sales.  

#### 3. Improve Delivery Operations:  
   - Since delivery dominates, ensure efficient routing and packaging for freshness.  
   - Partner with delivery services to expand reach beyond Houston.
